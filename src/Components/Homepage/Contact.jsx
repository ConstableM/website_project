        CS Related<br />
          
        Hello, I am a 2024 new Grad with a B.S. in CS from UWM-Milwaukee. I am currently open to anything, so please reach out! I really enjoy solving problems and the process of learning in general. My experience lately has mainly been in developing web applications, using frameworks like React, Django, Express, Next.js, and hosting through Digital Ocean. I have experience with database, UML, and state-machine design alongside          experience using MongoDb and Docker. Lastly, I have minor experience in game design. Please see my projects section for more details and always feel free to reach out.

When it comes to topics in CS, personally, I find low-level topics the most interesting to study. Technology today is magical, and I love learning how things work.          Quite honestly, I have a list of so many topics I want to deep-dive into, but as of the time of writing I am studying networking in more depth. Following this, I plan to study up on designing and           implementing firmware for embedded systems, and afterward I also really am interested in the topic of ML/AI, especially in regards to computer sight.<br /><br />

        Outside of work I love artistic hobbies. Painting, drawing, 3d modeling, and even code-generated assets that make use of frameworks like three.js. I also love to travel, over          the last 4 years I have had the opportunity to travel to many unique countries and experience so many new things. I won't bore anyone with extreme details on my hobbies here, but if you have similar interests, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to talk more!
