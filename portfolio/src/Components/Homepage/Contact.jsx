        CS Related<br />
          
          Hello, I am a new 2024 new Grad with a B.S. in CS from UWM-Milwaukee. I am currently open to anything so please reach out! I really enjoy solving problems and the process of learning in general I hate leaving topics
          as just black boxes that magically exist. My experience lately has mainly been in developing web-applications, using frameworks like React, Django, Tailwind, Next.js, and hosting through Digital Ocean. I have experience with database, UML, and state-machine design alongside
          experience using AWS (dynamoDB) and Docker. I also have experience in game design and non-web applications, please see my projects section for more details and always feel free to reach out.<br /> <br />
        
          When it comes to topics in CS personally I find low-level topics the most interesting to study. Technology today is magical and I love learning how things work on the most fundamental level.
          Quite honestly I have a list of so many topics I want to deep-dive into, but as of the time of writing though I'm studying networking in more depth, following this I plan to study up on designing and 
          implementing firmware for embedded systems, and aftwards I also really am interested in the topic of ML/AI especially in regards to computer sight.<br /><br />
          
        Non-CS Related<br />
          
          Outside of work I love artistic hobbies. Painting, drawing, 3d modeling, and even code generated assets that make use of frameworks like three.js. I also love to travel, over
          the last 4 years I have had the opportunity to travel to many unique countries and experience so many new things. I am always open to relocation, quite franky all I need to be happy in life 
          is an internet connection, food, water, and some kind of roof.<br /><br />
          
          Additionally I recently picked up archery, and am learning wire-weaving jewelry design and creation. I won't bore anyone with extreme details on my hobbys here, but 
          if you have similar interests feel free to reach out I'm always happy to talk more!<br />
